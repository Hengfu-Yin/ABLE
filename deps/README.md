## Deps

This folder contains the GNU Scientific Library ([GSL version 2.1](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)) and the Non-Linear Optimization ([NLopt version 2.4.2](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt)) library which are dependencies that are required for compiling `ABLE`. Further information on how they are to be installed can be found in the main `ABLE` [README](https://github.com/champost/ABLE/blob/master/README.md).
